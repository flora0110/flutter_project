BoxGame is the accompanying demo game for a tutorial that covers writing mobile games using Flame and Flutter. The tutorial is targetted towards developers of any level but has zero clue on where to start with game development.

The game is simple and focuses more on concepts like game loop, drawing on the screen, accepting player input, and how they all tie together.

Using Flutter as the base framework and the Flame plugin for it that is simple yet powerful enough to let you create all sorts of games.
